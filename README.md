This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cosmin-ticu/DS2_Ensemble-Stacking) contains all the codes, data files and outputs used in creating the final HTML report for the first homework assignment of the DS2 course. It is advised to download this entire repository as a ZIP or to clone it onto your local machine and set up its root folder as an R Project. This will allow you to run the codes and functions seamlessly.

Special credits go to:
